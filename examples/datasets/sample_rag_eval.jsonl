{"id": "rag_001", "input": {"query": "What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?"}, "output": {"answer": "RAG is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant information with text generation. It first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses that information to generate more accurate and informed responses."}, "reference": {"expected": "RAG combines information retrieval with generation to improve accuracy"}, "context": [{"text": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing technique that enhances text generation by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.", "source": "doc1.pdf", "score": 0.95}]}
{"id": "rag_002", "input": {"query": "How does RAG improve language model performance?"}, "output": {"answer": "RAG improves performance by providing models with relevant external knowledge during generation, reducing hallucinations and increasing factual accuracy. It allows models to access up-to-date information beyond their training data."}, "reference": {"expected": "RAG reduces hallucinations and provides current information"}, "context": [{"text": "By retrieving relevant documents, RAG helps language models generate more accurate responses and reduces the likelihood of generating false information (hallucinations).", "source": "doc2.pdf", "score": 0.88}, {"text": "RAG enables models to access information that may not have been present in their training data, including recent developments and domain-specific knowledge.", "source": "doc3.pdf", "score": 0.82}]}
{"id": "rag_003", "input": {"query": "What are the main components of a RAG system?"}, "output": {"answer": "A RAG system typically consists of three main components: 1) A retriever that finds relevant documents from a knowledge base, 2) A ranker that scores and selects the most relevant retrieved documents, and 3) A generator that produces the final response using both the query and retrieved context."}, "reference": {"expected": "RAG has retriever, ranker, and generator components"}, "context": [{"text": "RAG systems include a retrieval component for finding relevant documents, a ranking mechanism for selecting the best matches, and a generation component for producing responses.", "source": "architecture.pdf", "score": 0.92}]}
{"id": "rag_004", "input": {"query": "What is the difference between dense and sparse retrieval in RAG?"}, "output": {"answer": "Dense retrieval uses neural embeddings to represent queries and documents in a continuous vector space, enabling semantic matching. Sparse retrieval uses traditional keyword-based methods like TF-IDF or BM25. Dense retrieval is better at capturing semantic similarity, while sparse retrieval excels at exact keyword matches."}, "reference": {"expected": "Dense retrieval uses embeddings, sparse uses keywords"}, "context": [{"text": "Dense retrieval methods use neural networks to create vector representations, while sparse methods rely on term-frequency statistics and exact word matching.", "source": "retrieval_methods.pdf", "score": 0.89}]}
{"id": "rag_005", "input": {"query": "What are common challenges with RAG systems?"}, "output": {"answer": "Common RAG challenges include: 1) Retrieval quality - finding truly relevant documents, 2) Context length limitations, 3) Computational overhead from retrieval, 4) Potential for retrieving contradictory information, and 5) Maintaining consistency across multiple retrieved sources."}, "reference": {"expected": "RAG faces retrieval quality and consistency challenges"}, "context": [{"text": "RAG systems face challenges in retrieval accuracy, computational efficiency, and handling conflicting information from multiple sources.", "source": "challenges.pdf", "score": 0.85}, {"text": "Context window limitations and the need to balance retrieval quality with inference speed are ongoing challenges in RAG implementation.", "source": "limitations.pdf", "score": 0.78}]}
